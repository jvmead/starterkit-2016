# ssh to github!!

# To download repository: git clone eg.->git@github.com:jvmead/starterkit-2016.git

# create new branch 

git checkout -b <name>

# join files

git rebase -> orders based on history

get diff HEAD
get diff HEAD~1 -> shows history

git mv <file> # moves file and no need to 'add' as git mv tells git its been moved
